# Memory Manager — the skill that reads the filing cabinet

After every major task or failure, call `tools/memory_reflect.py` to log what
happened. Before important decisions, read the top entries from
`memory/semantic/LESSONS.md` and `memory/semantic/DECISIONS.md`.

## When to trigger full consolidation
- On explicit `reflect` trigger from the user.
- When the context window is getting full.
- When episodic memory exceeds ~500 entries.

## Consolidation steps
1. Load top-5 episodic entries by salience score.
2. Detect recurring patterns across the last 100 entries.
3. For patterns appearing ≥3 times, promote to `memory/semantic/LESSONS.md`.
4. Flag any skill with ≥3 failures in 14 days for rewrite (see `on_failure.py`).
5. Archive resolved working context to `memory/episodic/snapshots/`.
6. Commit via git so history is preserved: `git log memory/` is the agent's autobiography.

## Anti-patterns
- Do not auto-merge `personal/` into `semantic/` — user preferences are not general knowledge.
- Do not delete entries to "clean up" memory. Archive them.
- Do not promote lessons from a single incident. Require recurrence.

## Self-rewrite hook
Every 10 reflections, or when the same type of mistake appears 3+ times
recently, this skill's approach to salience or distillation needs adjustment.
Propose conservative edits and log the diff in `memory/semantic/DECISIONS.md`.
